# Silent Division by Zero in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript where a division by zero is silently handled, potentially masking errors.

## Bug Description

The `myFunction` function attempts to handle division by zero by explicitly returning 0. This approach avoids the typical runtime error, but it could hide a more significant problem in a larger application. The function does not throw an error or warn the user, which could lead to unexpected results.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js`.
3. Run the code using a JavaScript interpreter (like Node.js).
4. Observe that the result of `myFunction(10, 0)` is 0 instead of throwing an error.

## Solution

The solution, demonstrated in `bugSolution.js`, is to explicitly check for division by zero using `if` conditions and throw an error to prevent unexpected behavior.  This makes the error explicit and easier to track down during development.

## Lessons Learned

* Explicitly handling potential errors (like division by zero) is crucial for robust code.
* Returning default values in such cases, while seemingly convenient, can mask serious underlying issues.
* Always consider the implications of error handling and choose a solution that prioritizes clarity and maintainability.
